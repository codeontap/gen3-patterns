# executor-cookiecutter

Reusable templates for the Hamlet framework that help with getting started quickly with Hamlet.

The templates are provisioned using cookiecutter (https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter). The templates are intended to be called from within the Hamlet container environment. 

Typical usage for creation of a new Product CMDB, using the CLI to prompt you for basic template information.
```bash
hamlet generate product base --prompt
```

It is part of the broader [Hamlet](http://hamlet.io) devops framework.
